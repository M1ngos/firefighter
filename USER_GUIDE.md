## üìã Understanding Your CSV File

Your CSV file should look like this:

```csv
ID,Numero_Carta,Nome_Ficheiro,Caminho_Completo,Is_Active,Tipo_Biometria
1,10028588,FOTO_10028588.jpg,/path/to/photo.jpg,1,1
2,10028588,ASSINATURA_10028588.png,/path/to/signature.png,1,2
3,10028588,IMPRESSAO_DIGITAL_1.bmp,/path/to/fingerprint1.bmp,1,3
4,10028588,IMPRESSAO_DIGITAL_2.bmp,/path/to/fingerprint2.bmp,1,4
```

**Important Columns:**
- `Numero_Carta` - Driver's license number (required)
- `Caminho_Completo` - Full path to the image file
